## Overview
### Overview

This project is a simple recipe page that shows cooking instructions. I built it as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge to practice my web development skills. The page displays a recipe with ingredients, cooking steps, and nutrition facts in a clean and easy-to-read way. I focused on making the page look good on both mobile phones and computers.
